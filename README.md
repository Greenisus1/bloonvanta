# bloonvanta1.0.0

Original offline tower defense with10 waves, dart/splash towers, upgrade levels1-3, coin rewards and20 lives.

Fullscreen terminal, original Unicode/color block art. No accounts, ads, network, purchases, branded game assets, saved progress or desktop. Small first release, not feature parity with its commercial inspiration. Controls printed on screen. Space/P pauses, R resets, Esc/q exits. Python3+curses only; no pip downloads needed. Missing Python/curses stops with a clear error rather than silently running apt as root. Install checks dependencies, compiles source and creates this user's case-insensitive command variants in ~/.local/bin, without sudo. It refuses unrelated command overwrites; uninstall removes only owned links. If ~/.local/bin is not on PATH, installer prints a warning; no profile edits.
